        The role of the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            graphic designer
        </a>
        in the communication process is that of encoder
        or interpreter of the message. They work on the
        interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
        Usually, graphic design uses the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            aesthetics
        </a> of
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            typography
        </a>
        and the compositional arrangement of the text,
        ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings,
        and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses.
        The design work can be based on a customer's demand,
        a demand that ends up being established linguistically,
        either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design
        transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.
        <sup>[7]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas
        of knowledge focused on any visual communication system.
        For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies,
        or it can also be applied in the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            aviation
        </a> 
        world
        <sup>[8]</sup> or
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            space exploration
        </a>.
        <sup>[9][10]</sup>
        In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related
        as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings,
        this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of
        a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

        With origins in 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            Antiquity
        </a> and the 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            Middle Ages
        </a>,
        <sup>[11]</sup>
        graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            rise of printing
        </a> 
        in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            Inudstrial Revolution
        </a>.
        From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West,
        closely associated with
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            advertising
        </a> 
        in the 19th century
        <sup>[12]</sup>
        and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century.
        Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today,
        the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly
        because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay
        attention to human factors beyond the competence
        of the engineers who develop them.

    <p>
        In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            visual communication
        </a>
        in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising,
        art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared.
        They share many elements, theories, principles, practices,
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            languages
        </a>
        and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the
        ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. 
        In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information,
        form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the
        human experience."

        A graphic design project may involve the creative
        presentation of existing

        , ornament, and images. The "process school" is concerned with 
        communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages
        are transmitted and by which senders and receivers 
        encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a 
        construction of signs which through interaction with receivers,
        produces meaning; communication as an agent.

        Typography includes type design, modifying type 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            glyphs
        </a>
        and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified
        using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces,
        point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning
        (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

        Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers,
        graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital
        age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate
        or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font
        which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.

        Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page,
        such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always
        been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays
        such as web pages. Elements typically consist of   
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            type
        </a>
        (text),
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">
            images
        </a>
        (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics
        such as a

            dieline

        A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information,
        allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. 
        Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means
        of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for
        centuries, many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design.
        The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach
        to visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded
        as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of "designersaur." Today,
        grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether
        they are novices or veterans.
