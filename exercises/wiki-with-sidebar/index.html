                    The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing 
                    video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and 
                    published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main 
                    installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The 
                    Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), and was released 
                    worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and 
                    Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion 
                    and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of 
                    Tamriel, a continent on the planet Nirn. Its main story 
                    focuses on the player's character, the Dragonborn, on 
                    their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon 
                    who is prophesied to destroy the world. Over the course 
                    of the game, the player completes quests and develops the 
                    character by improving skills. The game continues the open 
                    world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player 
                    to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to 
                    ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.

                    Skyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, which was 
                    rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a 
                    unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial 
                    Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive 
                    producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by 
                    comparison. Upon release, the game received critical 
                    acclaim, with praise for its character advancement, world 
                    design, visuals, and dual-wielding combat, and it is 
                    considered to be one of the greatest video games ever 
                    made. Criticism targeted the melee combat, dragon battles, 
                    and numerous technical issues present at launch. The game 
                    shipped over seven million units within the first week of 
                    its release and had sold over 20 million units 
                    by June 2013.

                    Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released: 
                    Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn, which were bundled 
                    along with the base game into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 
                    - Legendary Edition released in June 2013. A remastered 
                    version, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition, 
                    was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 
                    October 2016, with all three DLC expansions and a 
                    graphical upgrade. A port for the Nintendo Switch was 
                    released in November 2017. A separate virtual reality-only 
                    version, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR, was released in 
                    November 2017 for PlayStation VR, and for Windows-based VR 
                    headsets in April 2018. In addition, the Special Edition 
                    was released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S as part 
                    of the compilation The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – 
                    Anniversary Edition in November 2021, and for Nintendo 
                    Switch in September 2022. A sequel, The Elder Scrolls VI, 
                    is currently in development.

                <p>
                    The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a fantasy action 
                    role-playing game, playable from either a first- or 
                    third-person perspective. The player may freely roam 
                    over the land of Skyrim, an open world environment 
                    consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, caves, 
                    cities, towns, fortresses, and villages.[1] Players 
                    may navigate the game world more quickly by riding 
                    horses, paying for a ride from a city's stable, or 
                    utilizing a fast-travel system that allows them to 
                    move their character immediately to a previously 
                    discovered location.[2]
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the game, players select their 
                    character's sex and race, with 10 choices for the 
                    latter including races of humans and fantasy races 
                    such as elves and orcs. The player chooses the 
                    character's appearance; this is not necessarily 
                    permanent, however, as an in-game mechanic allows for 
                    changing the appearance later.[3] Characters have three 
                    primary attributes: health is how much damage the 
                    character can take before dying, magicka is depleted to 
                    cast spells, and stamina allows the character to perform 
                    heavy "power attacks" or sprint. A status bar for each 
                    attribute appears onscreen when the attribute falls below 
                    its maximum value. Attributes regenerate over time and can 
                    be refilled faster by drinking potions, casting 
                    regenerative spells, or through various enchantments.
                    [4] Characters gain experience indirectly, via leveling 
                    up skills. The 18 skills are divided evenly among the 
                    three schools of combat, magic, and stealth. Each skill 
                    has its own experience bar, which increases when the 
                    character performs an action in-game related to the skill. 
                    For example, crafting a dagger increases the Smithing skill, 
                    and dealing damage with a bow increases the Archery skill. 
                    When a skill's experience bar fills, the skill levels up 
                    and the bar is reset. After enough skills level up, the 
                    character levels up, enabling the player to increase the 
                    maximum value of one of the three attributes and providing 
                    a perk point. Perk points can be spent immediately on a 
                    skill-specific perk or stored for later use.

                <p>
                    Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the world; the 
                    player may engage them in conversation (potentially 
                    leading to new quests or map locations), marry 
                    predetermined ones, or engage them in lethal or 
                    nonlethal combat. As in previous games in the series, 
                    killing certain individuals can make some quests or items 
                    unobtainable. Certain NPCs essential to the narrative 
                    cannot be killed by the player, and will survive attacks 
                    of any magnitude. Committing a crime like murder or theft 
                    accrues the player a bounty if the crime is witnessed, 
                    leading to confrontations with guards. Depending on some 
                    factors, including how serious the crime was, the player 
                    can choose to go to jail, pay the guard off, persuade the 
                    witness to forget about it, declare that one is a thane of 
                    a certain hold (which leads the guard to pardon the 
                    player), 'pacify' the guard or silence witnesses through 
                    killing them.[7][8]
                </p>
                <p>
                    NPCs frequently offer the player side-quests; some have 
                    parameters adjusted based on nearby unexplored areas. 
                    Some NPCs who are befriended or hired by the player may 
                    act as companions who will accompany the player and aid 
                    them in combat.[10] A number of individuals have quests 
                    that the player needs to complete in order to gain their 
                    services as a companion. The player may choose to join 
                    factions, organized groups of NPCs—for example, the Dark 
                    Brotherhood, a band of assassins.[11] Each of the factions 
                    has an associated quest path to progress through. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="Combat"> Combat</h3>
                <p>
                    The player's effectiveness in combat relies on the use of 
                    weapons, armor, and enchantments (which may be bought, 
                    found from containers, raided from dead bodies, stolen 
                    and/or forged) and on the use of magic spells: similarly, 
                    spells may be bought, stolen and/or unlocked by finding 
                    spell tomes.[failed verification] Weapons, shields, and 
                    magic are assigned to each hand allowing for 
                    dual-wielding, and can be swapped out through a 
                    quick-access menu of favorite items.[13][failed 
                    verification] Some weapons and spells require both hands. 
                    Shields can be used to fend off enemy attacks and reduce 
                    incurred damage or offensively through bashing attacks. 
                    Blunt, bladed, and hacking weapons can be used in close 
                    combat and each have specific advantages and roles. Power 
                    attacks expend stamina to temporarily stun/stagger an 
                    enemy and deal increased damage. Spells have several 
                    functions, both in combat (e.g. damaging or confusing 
                    enemies, resurrecting dead bodies and conjuring other 
                    entities, restoring the player's health and/or stamina) 
                    and out (e.g. showing the way to an objective, 
                    illuminating a dark room or turning iron into silver).[14] 
                    Bows are used for long-range combat and can be used to 
                    bash enemies in melee combat. The player can enter sneak 
                    mode to pickpocket or deliver powerful sneak attacks to 
                    unsuspecting enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When exploring the game world the player may encounter 
                    wildlife. Many creatures in the wilderness, such as 
                    wolves or bears, are immediately hostile towards the 
                    player, while other species are docile and will run 
                    away.[1] Skyrim is the first entry in The Elder Scrolls 
                    to include dragons in the game's wilderness, although 
                    dragons are frequently referenced/mentioned in several 
                    of the other games.[16] Like other creatures, dragons 
                    are generated randomly in the world and will engage in 
                    combat with NPCs, creatures and the player. Some dragons 
                    may attack cities and towns when in their proximity.[17] 
                    The player character can absorb the souls of dragons in 
                    order to use powerful spells called "dragon shouts" or 
                    "Thu'um". Each shout contains three words in the language 
                    spoken by dragons, and the strength of the shout will vary 
                    depending on how many words have been spoken. The words 
                    to shouts can be learned by visiting "word walls" in 
                    dungeons or around the wilderness. The words to each shout 
                    are unlocked for use by spending the absorbed souls of 
                    slain dragons.[18][19] A regeneration period limits the 
                    player's use of shouts in gameplay.

                    Skyrim is set 200 years after the events of The Elder 
                    Scrolls IV: Oblivion, although it is not a direct sequel.
                    [18] Skyrim is a cold and mountainous region in the north 
                    of the continent of Tamriel. It has traditionally been 
                    divided into nine administrative sections, called "holds", 
                    each governed by a jarl from a larger town. Of these 
                    settlements, five—Solitude, Windhelm, Markarth, Riften, 
                    and Whiterun—are larger and more powerful. The landscape 
                    is littered with forts, camps, and ruins, some of which 
                    were built by the now-extinct race of the Dwemer, or Deep 
                    Elves. The Nords, one of the human races, view Skyrim as 
                    their homeland, though members of other races populate 
                    Skyrim as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skyrim is a province of the much larger Empire, which 
                    comprise most of Tamriel. The Empire has recently fought 
                    a war with the elvish Aldmeri Dominion, who believe that 
                    they are racially superior to humans. While the conflict, 
                    known as the Great War, ended in a military stalemate 
                    after a hard-fought battle at the imperial capital, the 
                    greatly weakened Empire was forced to sign a humiliating 
                    peace treaty called the White-Gold Concordat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While most of Tamriel worship a religious pantheon of 
                    eight deities, the Nords of Skyrim are accustomed to 
                    worshiping a ninth god, Talos, the deified Nord general 
                    who founded the Empire. The Dominion, led by the 
                    intolerant Thalmor sect, rejects this notion and its 
                    implication that a man became greater than any elf. They 
                    instituted a clause in the Concordat forbidding Talos 
                    worship in the Empire. Motivated in part by this 
                    condition, Ulfric Stormcloak, the jarl of Windhelm, leads 
                    a rebellion against imperial rule, with the holds divided 
                    roughly evenly between the two sides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the ancient past, dragons ruled over vast swaths of 
                    Tamriel. Their hegemony was overthrown when three human 
                    warriors threw the dragon ruler, Alduin, forward in time 
                    using an Elder Scroll, a powerful and mysterious artifact. 
                    When Skyrim begins, the survival of the last dragon, the 
                    sage Paarthurnax, is a secret kept by an order of monks 
                    called the Greybeards. Within their monastery atop the 
                    Throat of the World, Skyrim's highest mountain, the 
                    Greybeards dedicate their lives to the Way of the Voice, 
                    a discipline for powerful draconic spells called "shouts". 
                    Rare warriors are "Dragonborn", having the ability to 
                    learn shouts intuitively by absorbing the souls of dead 
                    dragons. Ancient prophecy maintains that Alduin will 
                    return to consume the world, and a "Last Dragonborn" 
                    will defeat him.

                    The player character is Dragonborn and is typically 
                    referred to as such. The Dragonborn can be male or female, 
                    from one of ten races. Each of the ten races has, in 
                    addition to a bonus for certain skills, a power specific 
                    to their race – for example, Nords start with a bonus to 
                    several martial skills, and the ability to intimidate 
                    enemies for a short period. The player can recruit one 
                    NPC at a time as a follower, who can travel and fight 
                    alongside the Dragonborn; there are forty-five 
                    available followers in the base game, with thirteen more 
                    added in the downloadable expansions.

                    Outside of followers and Alduin, the primary antagonist, 
                    NPCs prominent to the plot of Skyrim include Balgruuf, 
                    Jarl of Whiterun, a town in the center of Skyrim; Arngeir, 
                    the leader of the Greybeards; Delphine and Esbern, two of 
                    the last members of the Blades, an order of warriors sworn 
                    to help the Dragonborn but nearly wiped out after the 
                    Great War; and Paarthurnax, the last surviving dragon and 
                    grandmaster of the Greybeards. Also notable are Ulfric and 
                    General Tullius, who command the Stormcloaks and Imperial 
                    Legion respectively. During the course of the game, the 
                    Dragonborn can join and assist either side to gain victory 
                    in the civil war. Other factions that the Dragonborn can 
                    elect to join include the Companions, a noble order of 
                    warriors; the College of Winterhold, an institution 
                    dedicated to the mystic arts and magic; the Thieves 
                    Guild, a league of burglars who have fallen on hard 
                    times; and the Dark Brotherhood, a fellowship of assassins.
