                        “Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken 
                        person...a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all 
                        fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, 
                        devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. 
                        Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio
                        and experimented with different sounds and collaborators...
                        This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were
                        meant to go on Red." - Taylor Swift. Includes 
                        9 unreleased songs from the vault.
