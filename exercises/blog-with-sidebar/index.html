                    On Stranger Things Day in 2022 (November 6), Netflix 
                    unveiled the news that Season 5’s first installment 
                    would be titled “Chapter One: The Crawl,” written 
                    by series creators Matt and Ross Duffer. Additionally, 
                    in an interview with 
                <a href="#Variety"> Variety</a>
                    , it was revealed that star 
                    Noah Schnapp, who plays Will Byers, had received three 
                    scripts, meaning much of Season 5 had already been 
                    completed before the since-ended

                    “We sent him the first three scripts for Season 5,” 
                    Matt Duffer told the outlet. According to the Duffers, 
                    they shared those with Schnapp to prepare the actor for 
                    his character’s latest adventure. “Will really takes 
                    center stage again in 5,” Ross revealed. “This emotional 
                    arc for him is what we feel is going to hopefully tie 
                    the whole series together. Will is used to being the 
                    young one, the introverted one, the one that’s being 
                    protected. So part of his journey, it’s not just 
                    sexuality — it’s Will 
                    coming into his own as a young man.”

                    return, one new cast member has been confirmed. The 
                    Terminator franchise’s Linda Hamilton will feature in 
                    a new role, as was revealed at Netflix’s TUDUM event 
                    earlier this summer. No additional details have been 
                    revealed at this time.

                    As shared by TUDUM, 10 Cloverfield Lane director Dan 
                    Trachtenberg will helm an episode of the show’s upcoming 
                    final season. It’s unclear which installment he’ll be 
                    directing at this time, but he likely joins the ranks of 
                    Shawn Levy, one of the show’s executive producers and 
                    go-to directors for the series. At this time, it hasn’t 
                    been announced or confirmed that Levy will direct, but 
                    considering his track record with previous seasons, we’re 
                    certainly willing to bet he’ll be back in the director’s 
                    chair, and according to 
                <a href="#IMDb">IMDb</a>
                    , he is listed as possibly 
                    helming Episodes 3 and 4.

                    Previs (previsualization or digital storyboarding) has 
                    already begun on the season, as the writers are back to 
                    work following the WGA strike, but without actors 
                    currently working, the results have produced a comedic 
                    mix of GIFs and clips shared by the writers online. 
                    “Hope the studios make a fair deal with SAG soon or 
                    else season 5 is looking like 
                <a href="#this">this</a>:” one post teased 
                    alongside a GIF of a virtual creation of Keery’s Steve. 
                    “FYI this is pre-vis for a scene in ep 1. So technically 
                    your first look at season 5. We told Joe he has to 
                    perform it EXACTLY like this,” they added.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a follow-up, the account shared another GIF from a 
                    pre-vis scene featuring Heaton’s Jonathan Byers and 
                    Keery’s Steve, with the caption, “They did Charlie dirty.” 
                    Keeping the silliness going, the writers shared a photo 
                    of Heaton alongside his digital representation which was 
                    supposedly snapped by Keery himself.

                    Another pre-vis shot was shared, this time as a video with 
                    sound. It appears to feature some characters in a car as 
                    they scream. “One more week without a deal. One more week 
                    closer to this,” the writers shared in reference to 
                    SAG-AFTRA’s ongoing fight for a fair deal with studios. 
                    “I highly recommend playing this with sound. It really 
                    improves it,” they added.
