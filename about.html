        I've been designing since I was a child. Art has been my passion
        and creating is what motivates me in life. Since the time I was two,
        I found every reason to draw and as I got older I applied my 
        talent to every day things. I've wanted to pursue college since 
        I was young but life had other plans for me. I settled down and had two 
        children and married. Once my youngest was one, I applied to an online 
        program through F.I.R.S.T Institute.

        Once at F.I.R.S.T Institute I took a course that
        explored me into photography. I found that I love doing candid
        photos and environmental photos. Capturing the moment of people in
        their own space and feelings is moving to me. Doing photography is
        newer to me than designing is. I love it just as much.
